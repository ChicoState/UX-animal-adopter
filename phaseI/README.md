# Phase I: Analyzing Users, Competitors, and Initial Designs

## Introduction

Our goal is to make rehoming and adopting an animal easier for the average person. We want potential adopters to adopt from verified listings, and also make rehoming easier for people who have found a pet they cannot keep themselves.

## Methods

We used both competitive analysis and heuristic evaluation to find the problems that people normally face when using adoption services, as well as find the things that users apreciate about the adoption services that are availble.

## Findings

Competitive Analysis
- Petfinder
  - Adopters like that they can heart pets that they are interested in potentially adopting. However, sometime the favorites and searches get cleared without any indication for why that occured.
  - Adopters can filter through who put a pet up for adoption, such as shelters, rescues, or independent users.
- Adopt-a-Pet
  - Users like the wide variety of pet options that extend beyond cats and dogs.
  - A large issue with the site is the trustworthyness of the website. The cause of this issue seems to be that the website doesn't verify listings, so false listings will be posted and used to steal money from adopters.
  - Some users believed that the messsages that are sent through the website don't actually send.
  - There is no notice is a pet that an adopter is interested in gets adopted. This could be due to rehomers failing to remove their listings after adoption or due to the website not registering that an adoption occured.
- Going to a shelter or rescue
  - Adopters are able to meet the pet immediately before going through with the adoption.
  - Workers at a shelter or rescue are able to fill you in about certain behavioral patterns of a pet.
  - Adopters don't know what's available at the shelter or rescue before going.

## Conclusions

!!! Discoveries derived from the methods and their findings. Interpret how the findings translate into new insights into UX design recommendations. Describe those recommendations and how they should shape future work. In this section, include the new design recommendations based on the latest user insights. !!!

## Caveats

!!! Considerations and/or limitations to the methods you chose and the findings/conclusions drawn from them. In other words, give warnings if there are limitations to your research such as not being able to find enough users of a particular demographic, the methods not being able to expose certain information, assumptions you made, etc. !!!
