# Phase III: Prototypes and User Testing

## Introduction

Animal Adopter is an application to make rehoming and adopting an animal easier for the average person. We want potential adopters to adopt from verified listings and also make rehoming easier for people who have found a pet they cannot keep themselves. In the process of achieving these goals, we hope that we can help more pets find their forever home. The goal of this phase was to evaluate the navigability and usability of the Animal Adopter application, ensuring that users can effectively use the application's features and provide feedback for improvement.

## Methods

The Animal Adopter usability team conducted Pilot tests with users on May 7th, 2024 (n = 7). Before testing began, all Usability Engineers worked together to generate a prototype of the AnimalAdopter application, filled out an IRB form, created an Informed Consent Form, and generated a Protocol/Script for the study. The Protocol outlines the structure of the study, including what tasks the participants are asked to complete, and what data will be collected/measured during the study. During the planning for the Pilot Test, the UX team determined that the main focus of this study would be the ability to navigate through all features of the website while remembering how to get from one place to another.
Participants for the study were other students from the same Usability Engineering class. Seven students signed up to participate in the Pilot Test. The only requirement for this study was that the participant must be over the age of 18.
For the Animal Adopter Test, the UX team followed a formative and think-aloud testing approach. Participants were asked to complete a variety of tasks to identify any issues in the site and to get an idea of different ways to improve it. They were encouraged to voice their thoughts as they worked through each task so the UX team could gain a better understanding of their struggles and thought process. Before participants were asked to start on the first task, they were asked a couple of background questions. These questions included: “Are you interested in adopting a pet?”, “Have you ever used an online pet adoption service?”, “Would you like to adopt from a specific shelter?”, and “What was difficult about adopting pets in the past?”.

## Findings

The quantitive findings from Task 1 revealed that 6 out of 7 participants completed the task, successfully using filters to narrow down breeds of animals. All participants (n = 7) successfully completed various tasks, though with varying levels of ease. Task 1, involving the use of filters to find animals, was completed successfully by all, but one participant struggled with the interface. For Tasks 2 through 6, which included using advanced filters, signing in, managing favorites, and creating accounts, the success rate was 100%, with the majority rating these tasks as "Very Easy." However, navigational challenges were noted, particularly in locating the favorites page and understanding filter options, which 1 out of 7 participants found difficult. Despite these issues, the overall feedback was positive, with participants appreciating the application's ease of use after overcoming initial hurdles. They suggested improvements like more visible and intuitive filter options and better access to the favorites feature. The qualitative feedback highlighted a strong potential for regular use for both adopting and rehoming pets, provided these adjustments were made.

## Conclusions

The Pilot Tests revealed that the standard conventions implemented in the website proved to be easy for users to understand and work with. The standard conventions matched the mental model of the participants because the layout was familiar to their own experiences. Each task was completed very quickly, which shows the efficiency that Animal Adopter provides. However, ease of use can be improved by having the filters viewable at all times, rather than hidden in a menu overlay. The favorites page should also be accessible in the navbar, so users can view their favorites more efficiently.

## Caveats

A significant limitation of this study was the selection of participants, who were fellow students from the same Usability Engineering class. This homogeneity may have influenced the findings, potentially overlooking diverse user needs and responses that could emerge from a broader demographic. Additionally, the UX team's inexperience in conducting pilot tests may have impacted the smooth execution and comprehensive data gathering, suggesting the need for more seasoned oversight in future tests.
