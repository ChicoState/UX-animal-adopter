# Animal Adopter

Animal Adopter is an application to make rehoming and adopting an animal easier for the average person. We want potential adopters to adopt from verified listings and also make rehoming easier for people who have found a pet they cannot keep themselves. In the process of achieving these goals, we hope that we can help more pets find their forever home.

# Phase I: Analyzing Users, Competitors, and Initial Designs

**Executive Summary**

Competitive analysis revealed that users value **different ways to filter** different animals up for adoption
Heuristic Evaluation of a close competitor revealed that **users appreciate shortcuts on the website.** Having to navigate a website using several buttons to get from one area to another becomes a hassle for users. 
Personas and Scenarios reflected the user needs:
- **Variety of users** will use our website
-  Not all adopters have as much experience with pets as others 
**Overload of information is important to avoid** 
The Sketches and Diagrams implement the form fill out feature that users will encounter and the profile creation feature

# Phase II: Refining interaction and designing wireframes

**Executive Summary**

 - **Informal feedback** suggested already-planned features, as well as opportunities for improvement of user experience and **satisfaction** for various functionalities, as well as suggestions for new functionalities:
    - Add information through Wikipedia links.
    - See shelter reviews being add which would be a great way to **verify the validity** of certain accounts.
 - **Cognitive Walkthroughs** discovered missing and incomplete features of the website while also highlighting the difficulties that users face when navigating the website. Some highlighted results include:
    - **Filters** may be difficult for those who are not as technologically informed.
    - Create a **duplicate form** button that will allow users to start a second form with the same information from a previous one.
 - **Wireframes** have been modified to support some of the missing features.
    - Some of the features, such as the Wikipedia links, have been deemed unfeasable.

    - **Quantitative** and **qualitative** data were received.
    - Tests showed that standard conventions were easily navigable for most users.
 - Animal Adopter was received well, but **visible filters** and easier access to **favorites** are desired by participants.
