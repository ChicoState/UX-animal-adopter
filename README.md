# Phase I: Analyzing Users, Competitors, and Initial Designs

**Executive Summary**

Competitive analysis revealed that users value **different ways to filter** different animals up for adoption
Heuristic Evaluation of a close competitor revealed that **users appreciate shortcuts on the website.** Having to navigate a website using several buttons to get from one area to another becomes a hassle for users. 
Personas and Scenarios reflected the user needs:
- **Variety of users** will use our website
-  Not all adopters have as much experience with pets as others 
**Overload of information is important to avoid** 
The Sketches and Diagrams implement the form fill out feature that users will encounter and the profile creation feature
